## Why finemusic?

There's nothing to be speicific I just created it to train on Node.js, Express, Templating Engines and deploying projects

### What I've learnt?

I learnt a lot with this simple project.

1. I knew more about MVC and started to apply it with minimal approach.
2. I went deep in npm modules and learnt how to get them working in my project right.
3. I started to read the documentation more than usual it helped in many issues.
4. I learnt about handlebars and how to setup a layout that for easy data injection.
5. I knew how backend validation is important even small validation can make sure that you have the right data.
6. Promises and callbacks are too complicated and Async/Await are easier to deal with.

### What I still need to improve

1. Code clarity is still not on point
2. Inconsistency and not making clear standards is still a problem
3. Need to read more to get more knowledge in JavaScript World

### What's coming next for this? //TODOS

1. I will try to improve the weak points mentioned before
